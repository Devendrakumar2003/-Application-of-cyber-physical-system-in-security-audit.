Face Recognition for Authentication in Banking System.
â€¢	Implemented a Face Recognition system for secure authentication in a banking system, utilizing YOLO 3, a powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). YOLO 3 enables rapid identification of facial features, enhancing security through efficient object detection and pattern analysis.Tech Stack: YOLO 3, CNN

###   FACE DETECTION

As we know that the there are millions of devices connected in the world via the internet, the 
cyber physical system plays a vital role in storing data, connecting devise and integrate sensing 
into physical infrastructure like internet and also Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine, and 
build on, elements from different scientific theories and engineering disciplines, including 
cybernetics, embedded systems, distributed control, sensor networks, control theory and 
systems engineering. Security audit refers to the testing and validating of a service and its 
security features provided by a company.
